## Overview

This JavaScript code formats a Christmas card on an html webpage with different colors, shapes, text, and a music element.

## Compiling and Using

To access the card, hit command o, open the project folder, and double click on the index.html to open the card in your browser. 

## Discussion

 I had many problems making my card backgroud green because I was trying to create a green border in the app.js section, instead of setting the background color to green in the index.html. I also had some problems deciding what to make on my card, but eventually I was able to figure it out. I also had some stuggles getting my white balls to be on the outside border, but after I set the width and height I was able to figure it out. 
 I had to ask my peers and research to figure out how to use a downloaded google font on my card. I had to use outside resources in order to download my Drake song off of YouTube so I could put it on my card.  To make my program I created 14 divs on my index.html page and assigned a variable to each div. I then seperatly styled each of those variables into the content and design I desired. I don't have anything I would change about my project.

## Drake Song Reasoning

I chose the song War by Drake because Drake is my favorite artist, and he dropped the song War on December 24th, 2019. That makes this the most "Christmas" song Drake has ever released.
